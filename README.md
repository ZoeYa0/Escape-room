# Escape-room

Escape Room — a two-part browser-based STEM puzzle game built with Godot 4.


## About
This project is a digital escape room designed to assess students’ problem-solving abilities through interdisciplinary thinking. Players solve a series of puzzles that require applying knowledge from multiple subjects, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.

Story: The game follows a narrative in which Professor Kamilla, a renowned biochemist, has gone missing. As players progress through the escape room, they uncover clues and gradually reveal that an extremist climate activist group has kidnapped her in an attempt to obtain her research, believing that humanity is responsible for Earth’s environmental crises.
Made by Zoe, Anastasiia, Elize and Kayra.
